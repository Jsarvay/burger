## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>
This app is hosted on heroku and requires no installation on the user's end.
    
## Usage
<a name="usage"></a>
Simply visit the deployed page and you will be able to use the app. Burgers can be added in the center column by entering text and then clicking the 'Add Burger' button. This will add the burger to the 'Waiting to be Devoured' column and give it a 'Devour' button. Click on this button to move it to the 'Burgers that have been devoured' column and give it a 'Throw in Trash' button. If 'Throw in Trash' is clicked, it can be deleted from the database.
